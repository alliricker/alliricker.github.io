My first Flatiron project is complete! I started off with a solid idea of what I wanted to do and sketched out the plan. This step was crucial to the success of the entire project and was tremendously helpful throughout the build. I decided to focus on scraping, as I was still grasping the concept and wanted to learn more. I also decided to focus on a topic that was deeply interesting to me (food!) which was motivating and really fun.

The gem uses Nokogiri to scrape data from one of my favorite food blogs, [Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/). This blog has many recipes for different dietary needs to accomodate any guest for the holidays. The user is prompted to enter a category (gluten-free, healthy-ish, vegan, or vegetarian) and is then presented with the corresponding list of recipies. The user can then select a recipe to see the list of ingredients needed, and may optionally view the recipe instructions. 

By the end of the build, I felt way more comfortable with scraping and had discovered great tools that were very helpful. I have used [Repl.it ](http://repl.it/)in the past, and it was a particularly helpful tool to use to parse through data. [This guide](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/html-parsing/) was also an essential for using Nokogiri. I also referenced the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), which provided really clear instructions for setting up a repository and adding commits. I also had some fun with the [colorize gem](http://github.com/fazibear/colorize) for the CLI. 

The best part of this project was being able to build something from scratch and realizing that I could not have done this a few months ago! All of the topics fell together and I was able to identify what I understood well and what I should study more.
