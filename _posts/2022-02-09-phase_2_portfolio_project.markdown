Phase 2 complete... almost! My app, Read-It, has been one of my favorite projects. I really enjoyed creating the graphics and color schemes. One of the most important lessons I learned while building this project is that proper planning is well worth the time. I thought I had planned everything out properly, but I quickly realized that I had forgotten a very essential column for the books table (user_id) and had to create a new migration. This was not a very difficult fix, but it could have been easily avoided. One little detail can completely derail an entire project. Thankfully, this is a mistake that I full heartedly learned from and will to my best to avoid in the future. I would also love to continue adding to this app in the future (scraping photos of books, adding a star rating system, etc) and I am excited to continue learning and finding new ideas to add.
